# Workflow

Every change moves through three stages. The person decides twice: on the spec with its plan, and
on the pull request. The risk level of the change decides whether the second decision is needed.

  /spec                    G0 + G1             implement                       G2           merge
Spec + plan (draft) ──► approved in the ──► code, gates, review, PR, CI ──► label ──────► GitHub
                        session                                          (medium, high)
                                                                          low: none
```

## Stage 1: Spec

- Skill: `/spec <topic>`. Output: `docs/specs/NNNN-<slug>.md` and a row in `docs/specs/README.md`.
- The spec names the goal, the scope, the terms from `docs/domain/glossary.md`, numbered acceptance
  criteria A1..An that a test or a walk-through can check, the contracts it touches, the
  implementation plan (`## Umsetzung`: files, steps, one test per criterion), the risk level from
  `harness/scripts/risk-level.sh` and whether an ADR is required (`harness/policies/adr.md`). A
  required ADR is written with the spec.
- Open questions are listed, not resolved by guessing. The skill asks them together with the
  approval.

**Gates G0 and G1, spec and plan approval.** `/spec` ends with one question to the person:
approve and implement, approve only, or change. On approval it writes `status: approved`, creates
the branch `<type>/<NNNN>-<slug>` and commits the spec there. Agents never write `approved`
without that answer.

## Stage 2: Implementation

- Skill: `implement` (`/implement <spec-id>`, or straight from `/spec`). It runs without a pause:
  code and tests by the plan, `make check`, a review of the branch before the push with fixes for
  blocking findings, push, pull request from `.github/pull_request_template.md`, the status
  `ai-review`, waiting for CI and fixing failures caused by the change.
- It stops only when the change leaves the approved plan: a higher risk level than in the spec,
  files or contracts that change what the spec promises, or an edge case the spec does not answer.
- The spec row moves to `in Arbeit`, then `Review` when the PR is open.

## Stage 3: Verification

Three independent sources of evidence:

1. **Quality gates** in CI: `test`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `sast`, `deps`, `drift`, `e2e`. All
   required; `drift` and `e2e` pass without running when the project has no generator or no
   end-to-end tests in CI.
   Locally a gate without its tool is skipped and named; CI always runs it.
2. **Reviews**: the skill `review`, in the developer's Claude Code session, before the push and
   after every later push. A script checks the rules that need no judgement
   (`harness/scripts/review-rules.sh`). Reviewer agents run the AI reviews the level needs: code
   always, security from medium, architecture for high or whenever `contracts/` or
   `docs/architecture/` changed. A second run reviews only what changed since the last reviewed
   commit. The result is the commit status `ai-review` and a report in the session, no PR comment.
   CI runs the rule check again as the required job `review-rules`. Details: `harness/review.md`.
3. **`/verify <PR>`**: walks the acceptance criteria of the spec, runs the affected tests, walks the
   application when a criterion names a screen, writes the result into the criteria table of the
   PR body and sets the spec row to `fertig` or `in Arbeit`.

**Gate G2, merge decision.** Medium and high risk need a review by a person: the director reads
the PR and sets the label `human-approved` after the last push, or a second person approves the
head commit (required when `second_reviewer_for` in `harness/config.yml` names the level). The
`human-gate` check in `auto-merge.yml` passes only then, and the same workflow enables auto-merge.
Low risk passes the gate without a review.

**Gate G3, verification evidence.** High risk needs the `/verify` result for the final commit in
the PR body before the person sets the label.

## Merge

- GitHub merges with auto-merge after every required check is green. `auto-merge.yml` enables it
  for low risk when the conditions in `harness/policies/auto-merge.md` hold, and for medium and
  high risk when `human-gate` passed.
- No agent merges. `gh pr merge` is denied for agents.
- After the merge the spec row moves to `done` with the PR number.

## Spec status values

| Status | Set by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `draft` | `/spec` | written, not approved |
| `approved` | `/spec` on the person's answer, or a person | G0 and G1 passed, implementation may start |
| `in Arbeit` | `implement`, `/verify` | code in progress or findings to fix |
| `Review` | `implement` | PR open, waiting for gates, reviews, verification |
| `fertig` | `/verify` | every criterion met, ready to merge |
| `done` | a person or `/verify` after merge | merged |
| `blockiert` | anyone | waits for a decision; the note names it |

## Rules that hold in every stage

- Never weaken a check, a test or a policy to make a change pass. Surface the conflict.
- Edge cases without an answer in the spec go back to the person. No silent workarounds.
- A skill updates only its own row in the status table and only its own section of the PR body.
- Report failing checks with their output. Do not report passing checks.
